Event-Related Recurrence Plots (**ERRP**)
=========================================



This is a larger collection of MATLAB function for investigating data, primarily event-related EEG data, 
using advanced, nonlinear methods such as:
 - recurrence plots
 - order patterns recurrence plots
 - symbolic dynamics
 - recurrence-based networks
 - order patterns networks (ORPAN)
 - and others


The key methods have been published,  but might require a deeper understanding of nonlinear dynamics, 
theoretical physics, cognitive and computational neuroscience. The corresponding references can be found in the 
documentation. Some function might depend on a dedicated toolbox for order patterns (https://github.com/stefanSchinkel/opTool)

For the analysis of data using recurrence plots the CRPToolbox (http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/CRPtoolbox/) is also needed. 
Furthermore it is highly recommend to read about the theory, guidelines and related methods at http://www.recurrence-plot.tk/

All the function are results of basic research and in **no** way production ready.
