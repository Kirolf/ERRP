Event-Related Recurrence Plots (**ERRP**)
=========================================



This is a larger collection of MATLAB function for investigating data, primarily event-related EEG data, 
using advanced, nonlinear methods such as:
 - recurrence plots
 - order patterns recurrence plots
 - symbolic dynamics
 - recurrence-based networks
 - order patterns networks (ORPAN)
 - and others

that were written from my diploma/PhD thesis. 

The key methods have been published,  but might require a deeper understanding of nonlinear dynamics, 
theoretical physics, cognitive and computational neuroscience. The corresponding references can be found in the 
documentation.
